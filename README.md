# simple-prio-3

this is a simple web interface to gather the prio 3 entries for world of warcraft classic and  inspired by sahne-team.de. I wanted to have self hosted alternative in case sahne-team is down and we are doing a prio run.

# how to install

* put the files on a php enabled web server
* change the password and lootfile in the config.php
* grant writing access for php to the lootfile and the config.php

#how to use
* login admin
* select the raid
* share the link
* show/hide the table via admin
